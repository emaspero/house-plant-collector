# House Plant Collector Project/Deliverable

## Overview
During Week 7 and Week 8 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course I started learning about Python, Relational Databases, SQL and, subsequently, about Django.  Step by step the instructor covered the following topics: 
- Control flow in Python
- Python functions, containers, classes and decorators
- SQL and Relational Data modeling
- Django urls, views, templates, models, class views, one to many/many to many models and authentication

The result of these two weeks is this House Plant Collector Project.

### Technologies Used
- Git/GitHub
- HTML and CSS
- Materialize
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- Python
- Django

### Features
This website allows you, not only to create a new record for Plants and Plant Pots, but it also allows you to keep track of which Plant Pots have been assigned to which Plant and to keep track of how many times the Plant has been watered. If it's watered more than once a day, the user will be prompted with a message stating, in fact, that the Plant was over-watered. The website only displays to a user the plants that have been created by the above-mentioned. 

### Challenges
On of the biggest challenges for me was trying to style the pages by using Materialize, I did not find it particularly flexible and I ended up keeping the styling very minimal.

### Features to be added in the future
I would like to populate this Project with a lot more content, starting from the actual styling of the Homepage and of the About section which I did overlook.
